# The MILOLab database for spatially resolved transcriptomic data

The package SPATAData gives access to our data base of spatial transcriptomic samples. Furthermore, it provides easy access to data sets that have been already published. We are continuously updating this collection so make sure to check for package updates on a regular basis. Please not that several of these data sets are not owned by us! Make sure to use the correct citation if you download and use them for your analysis. See more under [Citation](). 

Install with:

```
library(devtools)

# if you have not already
devtools::install_github("kueckelj/confuns")

# installs the package
devtools::install_github("theMILOlab/SPATAData")

```

Downloaded `SPATA2` objects can be used within the SPATA2 package. More info: https://themilolab.github.io/SPATA2/
