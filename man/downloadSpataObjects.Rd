\title{Download and save several SPATA2 objects}
\usage{
downloadSpataObjects(
  sample_names,
  files = NULL,
  folder = base::getwd(),
  overwrite = FALSE,
  adjust_link = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_names}{Character vector. The sample names of the \code{SPATA2} objects
to be downloaded. Use \code{validSampleNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{files}{Character vector or NULL. Specifies the file names under which the
\code{SPATA2} objects are saved. If character, the input must be of the same length
as the input for argument \code{sample_names}. If NULL, the files are named
according to the sample name.}

\item{folder}{Character value. If character, specifies the output
folder in which the \code{SPATA2} object is saved. Defaults to the working directory.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if file directories
under which downloaded files are to be saved already exist.}

\item{adjust_link}{Logical value. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Allows the function to adjust the link
if the download fails due to Google Drive warnings. See section below
for more information.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}
}
\value{
An invisible \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
Main function that downloads several \code{SPATA2} objects
at the same time and saves each as an .RDS file.
}
\section{Google Drive Warning}{

\code{SPATA2} objects are stored in a Google Drive repository and downloaded via their weblink as
stored in the \link[=sourceDataFrame]{source data.frame}. Often, \code{SPATA2} objects are too
large for the automatic Google Drive virus scan. As a result, the weblink initially leads
to a webpage that asks if you are okay with skipping this virus scan.

In cases where the Google Drive link leads to this warning page, the function
will automatically adjust the download link to bypass the warning and attempt
the download again. If the adjusted download still fails, an error message is
displayed, prompting the user to manually download the file using the provided link.

Since the virus scan cannot be performed by Google Drive regardless of whether
you download it from within R or manually, the function defaults to bypass this
warning automatically. If you prefer not to bypass the warning, you can set \code{adjust_link = FALSE}
In this case, the function will give a warning and ask you to download the object manually.

The downloaded objects do not contain viruses. The way they have been created,
uploaded as well as how the web links are added to the \link[=sourceDataFrame]{source data.frame}
can be reconstructed with the \emph{populate_\if{html}{\out{<location>}}} scripts provided on
the \href{https://github.com/theMILOlab/SPATAData}{SPATAData repository} on github under \emph{/scripts/}.

\examples{

# downloads three objects and
# saves them as "spata_objects/UKF275T.RDS", "spata_objects/UKF313t.RDS", ... etc.

  downloadSpataObjects(
    sample_names = c("UKF275T", "UKF313T", "UKF334T"),
    folder = "spata_objects" # the folder in which to save the files
   )

}
