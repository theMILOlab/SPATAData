\title{Download a SPATA2 object}
\usage{
downloadSpataObject(
  sample_name,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  file = FALSE,
  adjust_link = TRUE,
  timeout = 600,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_name}{Character value. The name of the sample you want to
download. Use \code{validSampleNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if file directories
under which downloaded files are to be saved already exist.}

\item{file}{If you want to save the object on disc:
The filename of the \code{SPATA2} object. Must end with \emph{'.RDS'} if provided
as a character. If \code{NULL}, the function saves the object
under the sample name with an \emph{'.RDS'} suffix. If \code{FALSE}, the saving
is skipped and the object is simply returned.}

\item{adjust_link}{Logical value. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Allows the function to adjust the link
if the download fails due to Google Drive warnings. See section below
for more information.}

\item{timeout}{Numeric value. Indicates the number of seconds the function has time
to download the object before the process is aborted. Defaults to 600s (10min).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{folder}{Character value. If character, specifies the output
folder in which the \code{SPATA2} object is saved. Defaults to the working directory.}
}
\value{
The downloaded \code{SPATA2} object.
}
\description{
Downloads a single \code{SPATA2} object and returns it.
}
\details{
If \code{file} is not \code{FALSE}. The downloaded \code{SPATA2} object is immediately saved after the download before
it is returned by the function. Note that the file directory is assembled by combining
\code{folder} and \code{file}!
}
\section{Google Drive Warning}{

\code{SPATA2} objects are stored in a Google Drive repository and downloaded via their weblink as
stored in the \link[=sourceDataFrame]{source data.frame}. Often, \code{SPATA2} objects are too
large for the automatic Google Drive virus scan. As a result, the weblink initially leads
to a webpage that asks if you are okay with skipping this virus scan.

In cases where the Google Drive link leads to this warning page, the function
will automatically adjust the download link to bypass the warning and attempt
the download again. If the adjusted download still fails, an error message is
displayed, prompting the user to manually download the file using the provided link.

Since the virus scan cannot be performed by Google Drive regardless of whether
you download it from within R or manually, the function defaults to bypass this
warning automatically. If you prefer not to bypass the warning, you can set \code{adjust_link = FALSE}
In this case, the function will give a warning and ask you to download the object manually.

The downloaded objects do not contain viruses. The way they have been created,
uploaded as well as how the web links are added to the \link[=sourceDataFrame]{source data.frame}
can be reconstructed with the \emph{populate_\if{html}{\out{<location>}}} scripts provided on
the \href{https://github.com/theMILOlab/SPATAData}{SPATAData repository} on github under \emph{/scripts/}.

\examples{

# download & assign (no saving on the disk)
object <- downloadSpataObject(sample_name = "UKF275T")

# download, assign and save on disk
# -> stores the file under ~/UKF275T.RDS (where '~' is your working directory)
object <- downloadSpataObject(sample_name = "UKF275T", file = TRUE)

# download, assign and save on disk in a specified directory
object <- downloadSpataObject(sample_name = "UKF275T", file = "my/path/to/spata_object.RDS")
